## TicTacToeUndoFunctionality

You are required to design and implement a Tic Tac Toe game that supports the standard rules and also provides an undo functionality for the players.

## Requirements:
- The game should be for two players: one player is 'X' and the other is 'O'.
- Players take turns to make a move.
- After each move, the game should check for a winner.
- If there is a winner or the board is full, the game should declare the result.
- Players should have an option to undo their last move.
- The game should support unlimited undos until the beginning of the game.

Implement a simple command-line interface for the view. No graphical user interface is needed.

## Constraints:
- The game is played on a 3x3 board.
- The game should keep track of the state of the board, the current player, and the history of moves.
